//! A USB driver for i.MX RT processors
//!
//! `imxrt-usbd` provides a [`usb-device`] USB bus implementation, allowing you
//! to add USB device features to your embedded Rust program. See each module
//! for usage and examples.
//!
//! To interface the library, you must define a safe implementation of [`Peripherals`].
//! See the trait documentation for more information.
//!
//! # General guidance
//!
//! The driver does not configure any of the CCM or CCM_ANALOG registers. You are
//! responsible for configuring these peripherals for proper USB functionality. See
//! the `imxrt-usbd` hardware examples to see different ways of configuring PLLs and
//! clocks.

/// A type that owns all USB register blocks
///
/// An implementation of `Peripherals` is expected to own the USB1
/// or USB2 registers. This includes
///
/// - USB core registers
/// - USB PHY registers
/// - USB non-core registers
/// - USB analog registers
///
/// When an instance of `Peripherals` exists, you must make sure that
/// nothing else, other than the owner of the `Peripherals` object,
/// accesses those registers.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `Peripherals` should only be implemented on a type that
/// owns the various register blocks required for all USB
/// operation. Incorrect usage, or failure to ensure exclusive
/// ownership, could lead to data races and incorrect USB functionality.
///
/// By implementing this trait, you ensure that the [`Instance`]
/// identifier is valid for your chip. Not all i.MX RT peripherals
/// have a USB2 peripheral instance, so you must ensure that the
/// implementation is correct for your chip.
///
/// # Example
///
/// A safe implementation of `Peripherals` that works with the
/// `imxrt-ral` register access layer. Assume that `ral` is
/// shorthand for `imxrt_ral`, like
///
/// ```
/// use imxrt_ral as ral;
/// ```
///
/// ```no_run
/// # mod ral {
/// #   use core::ops::Deref; pub struct Instance; impl Deref for Instance { type Target = u32; fn deref(&self) -> &u32 { unsafe { &*(0x402e0200 as *const u32)} } }
